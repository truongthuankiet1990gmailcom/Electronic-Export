<img width="750" alt="Electronic Export and Import Dashboard with cmdCode breakdown and partner data" src="Img/Electronic-Devices-Export.jpg">

This dashboard provides an in-depth view of global export and import data, broken down by product category (cmdCode) and partner country for the years 2013-2023. Using data visualization techniques, it presents the total value of exports and imports, the distribution of primary value by product code, and the performance across various countries.

The dashboard is ideal for finance, operations, and product teams to track performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions for optimizing trade relations and product offerings.

Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing global export and import data for the years 2013-2015. The dashboard breaks down the primary value of goods by product category (cmdCode) and country (partnerDesc), enabling an in-depth understanding of trade flow dynamics.

## Key points include:

- **Total value of exports vs. imports**

- **Performance by product category (cmdCode)**

- **Top performing partner countries (e.g., China, USA, South Korea)**

- **Yearly trends and comparisons across 2013-2025**

The data will help stakeholders better understand shifts in product demand, identify high-value trade relationships, and explore opportunities for improvement in trade strategy.

Recommendations & Next Steps

Monitor Export Performance: The strong performance of cmdCode 8517 (telecommunication products) should be leveraged to explore new markets for similar products or related goods.

Strengthen Trade Relations with Top Partners: Given the dominance of China, USA, and Rep. of Korea, focus on optimizing trade relations with these countries, enhancing product offerings based on demand.

Investigate Import Opportunities: The import data suggests certain cmdCodes (e.g., 8418 related to refrigerating equipment) are underperforming. Investigating these areas for potential growth or cost-saving opportunities may be beneficial.

Explore New Markets: Expanding partnerships with emerging markets, especially in regions like India and Southeast Asia, could further drive trade value and diversification.
